# spinor-formulation-of-the-einstein-hilbert-action
Palatini treated the metric and affine connection as independent variables. He rewrote the gravitational action, took the variation, and arrived at the Levi-Civita connection and Einstein’s equations in vacuum. Subsuquently, the tetrad was introduced to General Relativity. It was then realized that the action could also be written solely in terms of the vierbien and spin connection. Treating these quantities as independent, one arrives at the same result. Suprisingly, the action can be written solely in terms of the gamma matrices and spinor connection (as defined in the curved space Dirac equation). Treating these as independent, I show that one also arrives at the Levi-Civita connection and Einstein’s equations in vacuum.
